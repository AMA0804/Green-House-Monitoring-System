# Green-House-Monitoring-System
This project provides a greenhouse monitoring system designed to measure and monitor key environmental factors. The system uses the following components:  Potentiometers: Simulate NPK sensors to monitor nutrient levels. TEMT6000 Sensor: Measures light intensity inside the greenhouse. MQ-135 Sensor: Detects CO2 levels to ensure proper air quality.
